    "service_description":"Translation of literary works across a variety of genres and languages, including novels, short stories, poetry, plays, and other forms of literature. Translations can be done from and into a range of languages. The goal is to capture the essence and style of the original work while making it accessible to readers in the target language. Translating literary works is more than just translating the words. A skilled translator must also be able to translate the cultural nuances and literary devices that make each work unique. Proofreading and editing are also essential to ensure accuracy and maintain the integrity of the original work. Localization is another important aspect of literary translation, as it involves adapting the work to the target culture while still preserving the original author's voice and intent. Cultural consulting may also be necessary to ensure that the translated work is culturally appropriate and sensitive. Each project is approached with care and attention to detail, with customized solutions to meet clients' specific needs. The goal is to accurately reflect the original work while resonating with the target audience, making literary works accessible to readers across cultures and languages.",
